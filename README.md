This game is from The Ultimate Unreal Engine 2D Game Development Course by Cobra Code on Udemy. 

The game can be played with W, A, S, D buttons for basic movement, J for attack, K for Throw Sword ability, and L for jump. You can press J twice for the Double Jump ability after obtaining the necessary orb.

The goal is reaching to statue which is located right side of the map behind the boxes. In order to pass the boxes player must pick up the orbs which gives the player two different abilities by defeating enemies.

The first orb (Green) gives the Throw Sword ability. The second orb (Pink) gives the Double Jump ability.

It is so basic but it is my first course about Unreal Engine. 

The game was developed with Blueprint.
